Climate change is a global issue requiring data-driven insights.
Rising greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and land-use changes cause severe climate shifts.
EarthScape Climate Agency collects climate-related data from satellites, weather stations, and sensors.
The project aims to process, analyze, and visualize large-scale climate data using Hadoop.
